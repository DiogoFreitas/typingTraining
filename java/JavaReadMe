Hello. I used to read some code text. But for the moment I need to write something. So i got a tutorial in the internet and use these files to be able to write easily in the future.

HelloWorld.java:
   THe first program. I tried to understand Java in the Netbeans. It is so confused. I told that, but I have many reasons to explain. Doen't matter now. Truly trust and so, go on. We have a special week in the university. These day we have presentations, lectures. And in one of them i saw a informata talk about the git. To show his examples, he wrote inline many lines. I was surprised, twice. That answer result and insight, a simple motivation to practice and learn. That day i understod how near i should be, if i resolve some erros and mistakes about my point of view.
I do not the reason. But a Linux OS, one important and relevant language, and how to work with many experts professional, make me feel in the way. Neither a look like: "to far from my friends". I consider in my way, to have a lot of time. Well, only if the lord permit. Spend a life to a professional carrer. So lets go.

After many warnings. Many repair and replaces. Fineshed. Compile and running works. And the next text copy is...

AddNumbers.java:
How can I know? I take lessons, ANd just for that university classes I learned. So it is normal i will talk very well forever from that important place in my life.
"Could not find or load main class ..."
{The first likely cause is that you may have provided the wrong class name. ( Or... the right class name, but in the wrong form). Considering the example above, here a variety of wrong ways to specify the class name:
Example #1 - a simple class name:
All right if i don't put the extension in the command (java AddNumbers.java). Done!
}

IfElse.java:
What do you mean "nextInt()"?
'This method scans the next token of the input as an int.'
Probally made to only accept type int.

NestedIfElse.java:
All right. It is work. Good! And I recognize it is more simple practice in a framework. Hua hua hua!
Net beans, we be togheter very soon.

ForLoop.java:
Does it really works? Yes it is. I see hundres of lines comming to me type a lot. Ok. 

SimpleWhileLoopExample.java:
SwitchDemo.java:

I opened the file, but it has other code. The Swapping of Numbers had a simple "Hello World". Well, I will go to implement, a lite bit insecure if is about good complexity;
